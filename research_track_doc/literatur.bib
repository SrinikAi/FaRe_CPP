  abstract  = {Combined Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) is an area where no one-fits-all solution can exist. Many aspects of the domain, as well as operational requirements, have an effect on how algorithms and representations are designed. Frequently, trade-offs have to be made to build a system that is effective. We propose five research questions that we believe need to be answered to solve real-world problems that involve combined TAMP. We show which decisions and trade-offs should be made with respect to these research questions, and illustrate these on examples of existing application domains. By doing so, this article aims to provide a guideline for designing combined TAMP solutions that are adequate and effective in the target scenario.}

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous exploration and mapping in unknown environments is a critical capability for robots. Existing exploration techniques (e.g., heuristic-based and learning-based methods) do not consider the regional legacy issues, i.e., the great impact of smaller unexplored regions on the whole exploration process, which results in a dramatic reduction in their later exploration efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a Local-and-Global Strategy (LAGS) algorithm that combines a local exploration strategy with a global perception strategy, which considers and solves the regional legacy issues in the autonomous exploration process to improve exploration efficiency. Additionally, we further integrate Gaussian process regression (GPR), Bayesian optimization (BO) sampling, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models to efficiently explore unknown environments while ensuring the robot&rsquo;s safety. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method could explore unknown environments with shorter paths, higher efficiencies, and stronger adaptability on different unknown maps with different layouts and sizes.},
